Project Overview
This project aims to create a currency swap form where users can exchange assets between different currencies. The form will take user input (amount and source/target currencies) and calculate the exchange based on real-time token prices fetched from an API. Token images will be fetched from a predefined repository.

Key Components
React + TypeScript:

React is used to build the user interface (UI), with components organized for modularity and reusability.
TypeScript ensures type safety, improving code reliability and maintainability.
Vite:

Vite is used as the build tool for fast development and efficient bundling, offering a smooth experience during development.
API Integration:

The project fetches real-time token prices from this API to calculate exchange rates.
Token icons are sourced from the Switcheo token repository.
Form Functionality:

Input validation is implemented to ensure correct data entry.
The form provides real-time updates for currency conversion rates and handles errors gracefully.
Testing with Jest:

Jest is used for unit and integration testing to ensure the correctness of components and functionality.
