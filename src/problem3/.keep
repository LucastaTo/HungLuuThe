Inefficient Sorting: Sorting the balances array on every render with O(n log n) complexity can cause performance issues with large datasets.
Improvement: Optimize sorting or trigger it only when relevant data changes.

Unnecessary Re-renders: sortedBalances and formattedBalances are recalculated on every render, even if the balances or prices havenâ€™t changed.
Improvement: Memoize or recompute only when necessary.

Using Index as Key: Using index as a key in React lists can lead to bugs when the order of items changes.
Improvement: Use a unique identifier for each list item instead of the index.

Inconsistent Variable Naming: Inconsistent variable names (e.g., lhs, rhs) make the code harder to understand.
Improvement: Use clear, consistent names for better readability.

Unused Props Interface: The Props interface extends BoxProps but is not utilized.
Improvement: Remove unnecessary prop extensions to clean up the code.

Hardcoded Priorities: Blockchain priorities are hardcoded, limiting flexibility.
Improvement: Externalize priorities or make them configurable.

Repetitive Filtering in useMemo: Filtering is done inside useMemo, causing unnecessary recomputations on every render.
Improvement: Filter once before sorting to optimize performance.

Inefficient Sorting Logic: Sorting inside useMemo is inefficient and causes recalculation even when it's not needed.
Improvement: Optimize sorting and memoize only when relevant data changes.

Inconsistent useMemo: useMemo is used inefficiently, causing unnecessary recalculations.
Improvement: Fine-tune useMemo dependencies to avoid unnecessary recomputations.

Inefficient Number Formatting: Using toFixed() for formatting is inefficient and lacks flexibility.
Improvement: Use a more efficient and flexible formatting tool like Intl.NumberFormat or a library.

Unnecessary Re-computation of USD Value: Recalculating the USD value on every render is inefficient.
Improvement: Cache USD values and recompute only when the relevant data changes.

Key Prop in Rows Mapping: Using index as a key in dynamic lists is problematic.
Improvement: Use a unique identifier (e.g., balance.currency) as the key.

Unnecessary Destructuring: Destructuring props that are not used in the component.
Improvement: Remove unnecessary destructuring if props like children or className are not used.
